# Failure Models and Guarantees

## How Git Handles Failures and Maintains Consistency

Git operates in a distributed environment where failures are inevitable. This section explores the mathematical models Git uses to reason about failures, the guarantees it provides, and the tradeoffs involved in distributed version control.

## Failure Types

### Network Failures
- **Partition Tolerance**: Git repositories can operate independently during network splits
- **Eventual Consistency**: Repositories converge when connectivity is restored
- **No Single Point of Failure**: Every clone is a complete backup

### Node Failures
- **Crash Failures**: Repository corruption detection and recovery
- **Byzantine Failures**: Protection against malicious actors through cryptographic hashing
- **Data Loss**: Multiple distributed copies provide redundancy

### Concurrent Access
- **Race Conditions**: Lock-free operations using atomic reference updates
- **Merge Conflicts**: Deterministic conflict detection and resolution protocols
- **Branch Divergence**: Mathematical model for handling concurrent development

## Consistency Models

### Strong Consistency Within Repository
**Guarantee**: All operations on a single repository are strongly consistent
**Mechanism**: Atomic reference updates and immutable objects

```
Invariant: For any repository state S at time t,
    ∀ object o ∈ S: hash(o) = content(o)
    ∀ reference r ∈ S: r points to valid commit
```

### Eventual Consistency Between Repositories
**Guarantee**: Repositories with same set of commits will have identical state
**Mechanism**: Commutative merge operations and conflict resolution

### Causal Consistency
**Guarantee**: If commit A causally precedes commit B, all repositories will see A before B
**Mechanism**: DAG structure preserves causal relationships

## CAP Theorem and Git

Git's position in the CAP theorem space:

- **Consistency**: Strong within repository, eventual between repositories
- **Availability**: High - repositories can operate independently
- **Partition Tolerance**: Full - designed for distributed operation

**Tradeoff**: Git chooses Availability and Partition tolerance over immediate Consistency

## Mathematical Guarantees

### Integrity Guarantees
- **Cryptographic Integrity**: SHA-1/SHA-256 collision resistance
- **Structural Integrity**: Merkle tree properties ensure tamper detection
- **Referential Integrity**: All object references are validated

### Ordering Guarantees
- **Causal Order**: Parent-child relationships preserve happened-before relation
- **Topological Order**: Commit history respects dependency constraints
- **Merge Order**: Three-way merge produces deterministic results

### Durability Guarantees
- **Persistence**: Committed objects are immutable and durable
- **Replication**: Distributed nature provides natural backup
- **Recovery**: Repository can be reconstructed from any complete clone

## Conflict Resolution Models

### Merge Conflicts
**Mathematical Model**: When two branches modify the same region, conflict C is defined as:
```
C = {(line_range, branch_a_content, branch_b_content, base_content)}
```

**Resolution Strategy**: Manual resolution preserves developer intent while maintaining history integrity

### Semantic Conflicts
**Challenge**: Changes that don't conflict textually but break semantics
**Git's Approach**: Provides tools for detection but requires human judgment

## Distributed Consensus

### Git's Consensus Model
- **No Global Consensus**: Each repository maintains its own state
- **Local Consensus**: Strong consistency within single repository
- **Social Consensus**: Humans decide which branches are "authoritative"

### Comparison with Traditional Consensus
- **No Leader Election**: Every repository is equal
- **No Global State**: No need for distributed agreement
- **Conflict Resolution**: Merge algorithms handle concurrent changes

## Recovery Mechanisms

### Object Database Recovery
```
Recovery Steps:
1. Verify object integrity using hash validation
2. Rebuild reference database from objects
3. Reconstruct index from HEAD commit
4. Restore working directory
```

### Reference Recovery
- **RefLog**: Local history of reference changes
- **Backup Strategies**: Remote repositories as implicit backups
- **Fsck**: File system check for repository integrity

## Overview

Git's elegant design emerges from a carefully chosen set of mathematical foundations. This section explores the theoretical bedrock upon which Git's capabilities are built - from graph theory to cryptography, from string algorithms to information theory.

## Core Mathematical Concepts Behind Git

This section covers the mathematical structures, theorems, and concepts that Git relies upon. Understanding these foundations helps explain why Git works the way it does and what theoretical guarantees it provides.

## Graph Theory

### Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)
- **Definition**: A directed graph with no cycles
- **Properties**: Topological ordering, reachability, transitive reduction
- **Git Application**: Commit history forms a DAG where edges represent parent-child relationships

### Tree Structures
- **Spanning Trees**: Finding paths through commit history
- **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)**: Critical for merge algorithms
- **Reachability**: Determining which commits are ancestors of others

## Cryptographic Foundations

### Hash Functions
- **Properties**: Deterministic, fixed output size, collision resistant, avalanche effect
- **SHA-1/SHA-256**: Cryptographic hash functions used for object identification
- **Content Addressing**: Using hash as unique identifier

### Merkle Trees
- **Structure**: Binary tree where each node contains hash of its children
- **Properties**: Integrity verification, efficient comparison
- **Git Adaptation**: Git uses Merkle DAG (not strictly binary tree)

## Algorithmic Concepts

### String Algorithms
- **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**: Foundation for diff algorithms
- **Edit Distance**: Measuring changes between file versions
- **Delta Compression**: Efficient storage of object differences

### Partial Orders and Lattices
- **Partial Order**: Commit ancestry creates natural partial ordering
- **Join/Meet Operations**: Merge operations in the commit lattice
- **Topological Sorting**: Linearizing commit history

## Information Theory

### Compression Theory
- **Entropy**: Information content in repository objects
- **Delta Encoding**: Storing differences rather than full copies
- **Packfile Format**: Git's compression strategy

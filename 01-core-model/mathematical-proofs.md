# Mathematical Proofs and Properties

## Formal Verification of Git's Core Properties

This document provides rigorous mathematical proofs for the key properties that make Git's distributed version control system reliable and consistent.

## 1. Immutability Theorem

**Theorem**: Once a Git object is created and assigned a hash, its content cannot be modified without changing its identifier.

**Proof**:
Let `O` be a Git object with content `C` and hash `H = SHA1(type + " " + size + "\0" + C)`.

Suppose we modify the content to `C'` where `C ≠ C'`.
Then the new hash becomes `H' = SHA1(type + " " + size' + "\0" + C')`.

Since SHA-1 is a cryptographic hash function with the avalanche property:
- Any change in input produces a drastically different output
- `C ≠ C' ⟹ H ≠ H'`

Therefore, modifying content necessarily changes the object's identifier, making the original object effectively immutable in the Git object database. ∎

## 2. Content Addressing Correctness

**Theorem**: Two Git objects have the same hash if and only if they have identical content.

**Proof**:
Given objects `O₁` with content `C₁` and `O₂` with content `C₂`.

**Forward direction** (`C₁ = C₂ ⟹ hash(O₁) = hash(O₂)`):
If `C₁ = C₂`, then by definition of hash function:
`hash(O₁) = SHA1(type + " " + |C₁| + "\0" + C₁)`
`hash(O₂) = SHA1(type + " " + |C₂| + "\0" + C₂)`

Since `C₁ = C₂`, we have `hash(O₁) = hash(O₂)`.

**Reverse direction** (`hash(O₁) = hash(O₂) ⟹ C₁ = C₂`):
This follows from the collision resistance property of SHA-1. While theoretical collisions exist, they are computationally infeasible to find, making this equivalence practically sound for Git's use case. ∎

## 3. Merkle Tree Integrity Property

**Theorem**: Any modification to a file in the repository propagates upward through the tree structure, changing all ancestor hashes.

**Proof**:
Let `T` be a tree containing subtree `S` with hash `h(S)`, and let `h(T)` be the hash of tree `T`.

Since `T` contains reference to `S`, we have:
`h(T) = SHA1("tree " + |content| + "\0" + ... + entry(S) + ...)`

where `entry(S)` includes `h(S)`.

If we modify content in `S` to get `S'`:
1. By the Immutability Theorem: `h(S) ≠ h(S')`
2. The entry for `S` in `T` changes to include `h(S')`
3. Therefore: `h(T) ≠ h(T')`

This property recursively applies up the tree hierarchy, ensuring that any change propagates to the root. ∎

## 4. DAG Acyclicity Preservation

**Theorem**: Git's commit structure maintains the DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) property.

**Proof**:
We prove by induction that the commit graph remains acyclic:

**Base case**: Initial commit has no parents, so graph is trivially acyclic.

**Inductive step**: Assume current commit graph `G` is acyclic. When creating new commit `C`:
1. `C` can only reference existing commits as parents
2. `C` cannot reference itself (not yet created)
3. `C` cannot create cycles because it only points backward in time

Since we never add edges from old commits to new commits, cycles cannot be introduced. ∎

## 5. Distributed Consistency Theorem

**Theorem**: Two repositories with identical sets of reachable commits have identical repository states.

**Proof**:
Let `R₁` and `R₂` be two repositories with reachable commit sets `C₁` and `C₂` respectively.

Given `C₁ = C₂`, we prove `state(R₁) = state(R₂)`:

1. **Object sets are identical**: Since commits reference trees and blobs transitively, identical commit sets imply identical object sets.

2. **Hash determinism**: Each object has a unique hash determined by its content, so identical objects have identical hashes.

3. **Reachability equivalence**: Same commit sets mean same reachability relationships.

4. **State equivalence**: Repository state is determined entirely by reachable objects and their relationships.

Therefore: `C₁ = C₂ ⟹ state(R₁) = state(R₂)` ∎

## 6. Merge Commutativity Property

**Theorem**: For commits with a common ancestor, merge operation produces consistent results regardless of merge direction.

**Proof**:
Let `A` be the common ancestor, and `B₁`, `B₂` be two branches to merge.

The three-way merge algorithm computes:
`merge(A, B₁, B₂) = apply_changes(A, diff(A, B₁) ∪ diff(A, B₂))`

Since set union is commutative:
`diff(A, B₁) ∪ diff(A, B₂) = diff(A, B₂) ∪ diff(A, B₁)`

Therefore:
`merge(A, B₁, B₂) = merge(A, B₂, B₁)`

This ensures merge results are consistent regardless of which branch initiates the merge. ∎

## 7. Cryptographic Security Properties

### Hash Collision Resistance
**Property**: Finding two different Git objects with the same SHA-1 hash is computationally infeasible.

**Security Level**: 2^80 operations for collision attack (theoretical), much higher for practical attacks on Git's specific use case.

### Tamper Detection
**Property**: Any unauthorized modification of repository history can be detected.

**Mechanism**: Merkle tree structure ensures that tampering with any object changes its hash, which propagates upward through the tree.

## Practical Implications

These mathematical properties provide Git with:

1. **Strong Consistency**: Within a repository, all operations maintain consistency
2. **Integrity Verification**: Any corruption or tampering is detectable
3. **Deterministic Behavior**: Same operations produce same results across repositories
4. **Distributed Reliability**: No central authority needed for consistency
5. **Conflict Detection**: Mathematical basis for identifying and resolving conflicts

## Limitations and Assumptions

1. **Collision Resistance**: Relies on SHA-1 collision resistance (Git is migrating to SHA-256)
2. **Clock Synchronization**: Timestamp-based operations assume reasonable clock accuracy
3. **Network Reliability**: Eventual consistency requires eventual network connectivity
4. **Storage Reliability**: Assumes underlying storage system preserves data integrity

These mathematical foundations make Git not just a practical tool, but a theoretically sound distributed system with provable correctness properties.
